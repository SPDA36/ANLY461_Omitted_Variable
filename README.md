# PURPOSE
* The purpose of this notebook is to model two OLS regression models.  Model 1 is properly specified based on the toy data and Model 2 has an omitted variable, $x_3$.
* This notebook will demonstrate why $R^2$ is a deceptive metric.
* RMSE metric and residual plots are better model diagnostic tools than $R^2$
